post-Groovy music bot for servers i'm in

i won't offer support for this, it requires a Lavalink server and all that so make sure you have that running, then change values from the code accordingly

i will run an instance of this publicly, invite [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=889928187746873344&permissions=412689493312&scope=bot)
